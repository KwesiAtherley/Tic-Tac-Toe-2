# tic-tac-toe-client

### Tic Tac Toe Game built using
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Bootstrap
* AJAX

### The goal was to keep the application as simple as possible. While using the techniques and methods we learned in the first unit of the program.
### Focused on building out the API aspect of the project first, then moved on to game logic and finally some light css to make the application as presentable as possible.
### Still to be addressed - making the application truly mobile friendly and more aesthetically pleasing.
