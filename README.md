# tic-tac-toe-client-2

### My first Tic Tac Toe project was done in four days after a two week introduction to web development. I approached this version of the project as an opportunity to apply some of the skills learned over the course of my experience at General Assembly. I chose to leave the game logic and functionality aspect of the project as is, to show the growth between my first development project and my most current.

### Tic Tac Toe Game built using
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Bootstrap
* AJAX

### The goal was to keep the application as simple as possible. While using the techniques and methods we learned in the first unit of the program.
### Focused on building out the API aspect of the project first, then moved on to game logic and finally some light css to make the application as presentable as possible.
### Still to be addressed - making the application truly mobile friendly and more aesthetically pleasing.
